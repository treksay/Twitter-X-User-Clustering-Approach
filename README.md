# Twitter-User-Clustering-Approach

In this study, we propose a novel method for clustering Twitter users based on two aspects: structural and content. We opted for an approach splitted into three consecutive phases that begins with clustering via the graph network structure, then proceeds with merging the obtained clusters into content clustering based on two features. The first is the hashtags usage of the previous obtained clusters and the second is based on generating topics of interest from obtained cluster to yield final clusters of users.
